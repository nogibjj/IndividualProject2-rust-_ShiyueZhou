1. Users provide two integers as input via the command line by running:
```bash
cargo run -- num1 num2
```
2. The tool multiplies the two numbers and prints the result in a user-friendly format.

3. The project is integrated with a CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality through automated testing and linting.
